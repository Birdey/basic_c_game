## About

This is my terrible attempt to make a text based RPG as my first ever C Program.

It will most likely just be a basic thing i work on slowly from time to time, and not an active project.
Just mainly a way for me to familiarize myself with the C programming language.

Feel free to help and add stupid things to this project...

## Dependencies

- [JSON-C](http://json-c.github.io/json-c/)
